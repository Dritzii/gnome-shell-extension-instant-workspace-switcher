# Instant Workspace Switcher for GNOME 40+

This GNOME shell extension disables the workspace switching animation. All other animations, including the trackpad swipe to change workspace are preserved.

Switching workspaces with keyboard shortcuts happen instantly, akin to a window manager like i3.

## Manual Installation

1. Clone the repo & copy the folder instantworkspaceswitcher@amalantony.net to \$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/amalantony/gnome-shell-extension-instant-workspace-switcher.git
   cd gnome-shell-extension-instant-workspace-switcher
   cp -r instantworkspaceswitcher@amalantony.net/ ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
   ```

2. Log out of your current session and log back in.

3. Open the Extensions app, and enable the extension.
